# How Much Do My Cryptocurrencies Value

A dead simple crypto-balance calculator

## Why?

I recently started experimenting with _cryptocurrencies_ and I wanted to have a simple snippet that tells me my current, would-be balance â€” the current value of all my assets in their original buy-in _fiat_.

## How to use

1. Log your transactions in the _assets.json_ (See the _example.json_ for help) 
2. `node index`

## Disclaimer

This is only a snippet, nothing more. I was too lazy doing something else...
